1. Project Title GreenRoot – An AI-Powered Crop Recommendation and Farm Management System.

2. Problem Statement Many farmers face difficulties in selecting the right crop due to unpredictable weather, soil conditions, and market fluctuations. This leads to       reduced yield and financial loss. GreenRoot helps farmers by providing AI-driven crop recommendations based on soil pH, temperature, and rainfall data. It also          allows farmers to store, view, update, and manage farm data using an interactive web platform with a secure relational database.

3. System Architecture Frontend (React.js) → Backend (Node.js + Express API) → Database (MySQL) → AI Module (Flask / TensorFlow) Frontend → Backend (API) → Database        Example stack:

Frontend: React.js with React Router (for pages like Login, Dashboard, and Crop Suggestion)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js REST API (handles CRUD + AI requests)

Database:MySQL (Relational database with structured tables and relationships)

Authentication: MySQL (Relational database with structured tables and relationships)

AI Module: Python (Flask API) integrated with trained ML model

Hosting: ○ Frontend → Vercel / Netlify ○ Backend → Render / Railway ○ Database → MySQL on Aiven / Railway / PlanetScale

4. Key Features Category Features Authentication & Secure farmer registration and login using JWT (with bcrypt password encryption) Authorization

  1. CRUD Operations (API + DB) Farmers can create, read, update, and delete farm and soil data using REST APIs connected to MySQL tables.

  2. Search, Sort, Filter, PaginationSQL queries support filtering by crop or region, sorting by pH or rainfall, and pagination using LIMIT/OFFSET.

  3. AI Crop Recommendation Suggests the best crop for given soil and weather parameters using a trained machine learning model.

  4. Frontend Routing Pages: Home, Login, Signup, Dashboard, Add Farm, Crop Recommendation.

  5. Weather Integration Fetches real-time temperature and rainfall data via the OpenWeather API.

  6. Hosting Fully hosted: Frontend (Vercel/Netlify), Backend(Render/Railway), Database (MySQL).
